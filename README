As instructed by the professor, I have hardcoded the number of edges to make a for-loop
to read in all the edges. I have also hardcoded the number of stages to be used in my code.

My code prints out the shortest path twice. The first path is generated by the forward approach.
The second path is generated by the backward approach. I did not label this in the output because
the professor told me not to.

My code also only takes in integer weights. The book/link provided by the professor had pseudocode
that accounted for floating point numbers. I followed that code except I assumed all weights will
be integers. My code will not work for doubles, floating points, or anything else. It will only work
for integers.
